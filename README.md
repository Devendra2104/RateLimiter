# RateLimiter
A java Application for rate limiting Rest Api's . Preventing them from DOS attacks.

I Have used Java language for it. The SpringBoot Framework to be specific.

Created Api end points and protected them at api level using Token Bucket Algorithm and Redis server(For Storing key value pairs and setting TTL for 1min).
